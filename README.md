# Higher-level programming - Python 3 

This repository contains some of the programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Software Engineering programme.

These projects began at the Sprint 2 of the Foundation  Curriculum.

Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained are as follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World] (./0x00-python-hello_world) 
* [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) 
* [0x02-python-import_modules](./0x02-python-import_modules) 
* [0x03-python-data_structures](./0x03-python-data_structures) 
* [0x04-python-more_data_structures](./0x04-python-more_data_structures)
